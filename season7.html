<h1>Season 7</h1>
<p>One of the most map changing ones and best in my opinion not only because it was around xmas which gave us a lot of challanges which gave us rewards such as emotes
, spray and a new glider. It gave joy to everyone with a new battle pass but at the end of the season dissapoint everyone which it didn't had a good final event.
</p>
<p>BUT it did had a great cross over which it was <b>FORNITE X MARSHMELLO</b> One of the most fun cross overs yet and the most waited</p>
